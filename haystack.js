let paragraph = "The Apollo 11 mission was the first spaceflight to land humans on the Moon and marked a pivotal moment in human history. Launched by NASA on July 16, 1969, it carried astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins aboard the Saturn V rocket. The spacecraft consisted of three parts: the Command Module “Columbia,” the Service Module, and the Lunar Module “Eagle.” Michael Collins remained in orbit in Columbia while Armstrong and Aldrin descended to the Moon in Eagle. On July 20, 1969, the Lunar Module touched down in the Sea of Tranquility. Armstrong was the first to exit the lander, famously declaring, “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.” Moments later, Aldrin joined him on the surface, describing the lunar landscape as “magnificent desolation.” The astronauts spent about two and a half hours outside the module, collecting samples and taking photographs. They planted the American flag and left behind a plaque that read, “We came in peace for all mankind.” In total, they gathered 47.5 pounds of lunar material to bring back to Earth. After their moonwalk, Armstrong and Aldrin returned to the Lunar Module and prepared for liftoff. The ascent stage launched them back into lunar orbit to rendezvous with Collins. Once reunited, the three astronauts began their return journey. The spacecraft splashed down safely in the Pacific Ocean on July 24, 1969. The crew was recovered by the USS Hornet, a Navy aircraft carrier. Due to concerns about lunar germs, they spent several days in quarantine. The mission fulfilled President John F. Kennedy’s 1961 goal of landing a man on the Moon before the decade’s end. Apollo 11 demonstrated America’s technological prowess during the Cold War space race. It boosted national pride and inspired generations of scientists and explorers. The success of the mission laid the foundation for future lunar exploration. Apollo 11 remains a symbol of human ingenuity, courage, and the power of teamwork.";
